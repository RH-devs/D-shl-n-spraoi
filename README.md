__Design__

* Font

  * Google font family ‘Lato’ and 'sans-serif' was used on every page of the quiz website limiting with size variations and weight. I selected these fonts because it is readable and suits the purpose of the online quiz website. The three pages created have mix of both fonts. 

 * Color Scheme

I used a shade of white as the body background color and the shade of burgundy, black & blue for texts and buttons. The colors were selected from a collage using Coolors.

 * Imagery

There isn't much images in the quiz except for the image logo that was used alongside the name of the quiz game on the Homepage and icon used on the result page for feedback message based on the user's score.

## Testing

For testing, I tried take it in two dimensions in testing the site. The first stage was to continuously test as the site was being developed. Upon styling the site I would check the application of the styling being applied within a live server window. This allowed me to confirm the styling was being applied correctly and the page was behaving as desired. Upon coding with JavaScript, I would check if the site is interactive just as it should.
For the second stage of testing, I utilized a more formal structured approach and created a test schedule for each page. I then proceeded to run through the tests for each device making a note of any errors or differences to the designed behavior as I ran through the testing.
I performed testing using following devices/browsers:

__Component level Testing__
*	Compatibility
   * The website was tested and it is working on different browsers: Chrome, Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge.

* Homepage button
   * The homepage button on the Quiz page directs users back to the homepage when clicked on.

* Submit button
   * The submit button on the home is working, a personalized welcome message shows up to the user immediately a name is inputted on the username field and clicks on the submit button.

* The name input text is required, no password is required and it won't accept with empty data. No data is sent to any server.

* Social media links (footer)
   * The social media links are working and opening on a separate new tab on the browser.

__User level Testing__

My friends and family members were requested play the quiz using their own gadgets (mobiles, laptops, etc.) The website was also submitted in the peer-code-review channel on the CI Slack community.
* Overall Navigation is okay
