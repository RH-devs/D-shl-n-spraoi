__Design__

* Font

  * Google font family ‘Lato’ and 'sans-serif' was used on every page of the quiz website limiting with size variations and weight. I selected these fonts because it is readable and suits the purpose of the online quiz website. The three pages created have mix of both fonts. 

 * Color Scheme

I used a shade of white as the body background color and the shade of burgundy, black & blue for texts and buttons. The colors were selected from a collage using Coolors.

 * Imagery

There isn't much images in the quiz except for the image logo that was used alongside the name of the quiz game on the Homepage and icon used on the result page for feedback message based on the user's score.
