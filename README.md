__Design__

* Font

  * Google font family ‘Lato’ and 'sans-serif' was used on every page of the quiz website limiting with size variations and weight. I selected these fonts because it is readable and suits the purpose of the online quiz website. The three pages created have mix of both fonts. 

 * Color Scheme

I used a shade of white as the body background color and the shade of burgundy, black & blue for texts and buttons. The colors were selected from a collage using Coolors.

 * Imagery

There isn't much images in the quiz except for the image logo that was used alongside the name of the quiz game on the Homepage and icon used on the result page for feedback message based on the user's score.

## Testing

For testing, I tried take it in two dimensions in testing the site. The first stage was to continuously test as the site was being developed. Upon styling the site I would check the application of the styling being applied within a live server window. This allowed me to confirm the styling was being applied correctly and the page was behaving as desired. Upon coding with JavaScript, I would check if the site is interactive just as it should.
For the second stage of testing, I utilized a more formal structured approach and created a test schedule for each page. I then proceeded to run through the tests for each device making a note of any errors or differences to the designed behavior as I ran through the testing.
I performed testing using following devices/browsers:

* Desktop computer: 2560 x 1440p
 * Google Chrome
 * Microsoft Edge
*	Samsung Tablet
*	iPhone X: 828 x 1792 display
 * iOS Safari
* Andriod: 
* I also utilized the Chrome and Microsoft edge developer tools to simulate the display on other devices and test the responsiveness of the site.
